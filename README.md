# FRESCO
Storage for my FRESCO input files

If you are having problems running them or find errors, please let me know.

In addition, it would be appreciated if you let me know if you use my input files as a basis for something else, and credit me as providing the framework. For what it's worth, a few of my inputs are based on input files given to me by Stephen Gillespie of the University of York.
